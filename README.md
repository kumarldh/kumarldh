# ðŸ‘‹! This is GitHub profile of Kumar Chetan Sharma!

I am your run of the mill full stack developer. I am very good with PHP(!surprising!), JavaScript(ES6 onwards and backwards) and node.js. I have worked on Java and can also do Python. Some interesting things about me:
* I featured as a co author on a book on JavaScript. I am very much scared of JavaScript.
* I call myself a full stack guy but I do not know what are JOINS in MySQL.
* I have written an Android App, simple bots in JavaScript, Python and PHP but I could not write iterative way to calculate Fibonacci series.
* I have pledged my eyes.

If you are really interested in getting in touch, I can be found on linkedin, twitter, facebook and on github.
