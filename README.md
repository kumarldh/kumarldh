# ðŸ‘‹! This is GitHub profile of Kumar Chetan Sharma!

I am a typical full-stack developer who began by mastering HTML and CSS, initially creating web pages with table-based layouts. I then ventured into ASP, although due to cost considerations, I swiftly transitioned to PHP, specifically PHP3 at that time. I am proficient in PHP, JavaScript (from ES6 onwards to older versions), and Node.js. Additionally, I have experience with Java and Python. Some intriguing aspects about me include...
* [I featured as a co author on a book on JavaScript. I am very much scared of JavaScript.](https://read.amazon.in/kp/embed?asin=B00E7NCAYA&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_RQGJ03PXMQ12TWSKDQZC)
